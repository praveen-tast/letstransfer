<strong>Do I need to be connected to the Internet to use this app?</strong>

No, you don't need to be connected to the internet while using this app, which will help you avoid expensive roaming charges. The only times you need to be
 connected is when you download the app, when you update its content, and to use some optional features, such as turn by turn directions.

<strong>Can I download the cities over a 3G connection? Or should I download the city data over Wifi?</strong>

You can download the city data over 3G or Wifi, however, we recommend downloading over Wifi. The main reason 
is some service providers have a size limit for the file size that can be downloaded over 3G, and will truncate the file once the size limit is reached, causing an error in the app.
 Downloading over Wifi, is usually faster, and you are not subjected to the size limits of service providers.
